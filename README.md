This Repo contains my workings for a Electro Harmonics Big Muff Pi Digital Emulation. The distortion, tone and gain pots are emulated using various DSP techinues.
Included is a MATLAB application and MATLAB script.

## Loading the App

The script has a few dependent functions. To load and run the script, please open main and run from there. <br>

I have given three smaller clipped tracks to act as examples to be loaded. Please note this is for educational use and I do not own the rights to them.
